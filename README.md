# PCB-Coaster-Floppy-Disk-Shaped
 a coaster PCB that looks like a floppy disk
# Eagle 8.3.1 Free Edition board file

# Note:
# The dimensions are rounded to next mm,
# It is not supposed to be a real representation of a floppy disk; instead it is meant to be recognisable and look ok at the same time.
