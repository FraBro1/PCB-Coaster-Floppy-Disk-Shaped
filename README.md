# PCB-Coaster-Floppy-Disk-Shaped
 a coaster PCB that looks like a floppy disk
# Eagle 8.3.1 Free Edition board file

# Note:
# The dimensions are rounded to next mm,
in fact, everything is set to mm or 1/2 of a mm.
The grid is set to mm too!

# It is not supposed to be a real representation of a floppy disk; instead it is meant to be recognisable and look ok at the same time.
# :-)

# Without the Gerber files it is not advised to get PCBs produced, they will most likely look wrong.
# Initial Gerbers are added for convenience.
# I purposedly did not 'drill' the holes for Write Protect and HD Detect as it would add to costs.

The soldermask has been edited (again); Eagle didn't like the polygon fill for some reason, changed it to rects.
